## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. Basically a place where you can store content and keep track of the changes made to it. Both stored on the developer's computer and central server.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
Git just stores contents and keep track of the changes made to it, while GitHub manages Git repositories
3. Why do we create a branch?
So any changes we make ,to the branch line, it doesn't mess with the main line.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The purpose of a pull request is when the developer is ready to merge the changes of the branch or branches made to the main branch 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
Use git checkout -b "enter branch name"
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git merge' lets you merge branches into one single branch.'git fetch' lets you know that there are changes pending without bringing the changes into the local repository. 'git pull' immediately updates the local repo to match that content. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
This happens when Git can't automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Open the file and make the necesaary changes
